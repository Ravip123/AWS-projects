# Bouncing Ball Project
# Bouncing Ball Project

This is a simple programming project that demonstrates animation, movement logic and basic physics concepts like gravity and bouncing effect.

---

## 🎯 Objective
- Practice programming logic
- Understand motion / velocity
- Work with animations
- Improve problem-solving thinking

---

## 🧠 What This Project Does
- Creates a ball on screen
- The ball moves automatically
- When it hits edges, it bounces back
- Mimics simple gravity & motion logic

---

## 🛠️ Possible Implementations
This project can be implemented in:
- Python (Tkinter / Pygame)
- HTML CSS JavaScript (Canvas animation)
- Java
- Any GUI platform

(Currently using whichever version is uploaded here)

---

## 🚀 Learning Outcome
From this project I learned:

✔ Animation handling  
✔ Coordinate movement  
✔ Edge collision detection  
✔ Basic physics logic  
✔ Cleaner coding structure

More enhancements planned:
- Multiple balls
- Random colors
- Speed control
- UI improvements
